#Requirements
- After reading through the requirements below, it is recommended you start with a mockup and follow the steps described in "Thinking in React" to complete your application. Remember, stay organized!

- Your todo list application must have:

- A heading labeling it as a "todo list."
- A list of "todo" items, which are strings listing activities to be accomplished (e.g. "find that missing sock"). Each "todo" item should have:

- A checkbox next to it which indicates whether it is "complete."
- A "delete" button next to it which removes it from the list.

- The "delete" button should be disabled unless the todo is complete!
- An "edit" button that replaces the todo string with a text input used to edit the todo.

- Hint: bind the value of this text input to a piece of state so that it is always accurate, even when first displayed!
- When this text input is active, the "delete" and "edit" buttons should be hidden, and a "save" button should appear. The "save" button should save any changes made to the todo within the text input.
- An input element that creates new todo items and adds them to the list.
- New todos should be added to the top of the list visually; the oldest todos should be at the bottom.
- Here is a simple example of what your application might look like upon completion:
